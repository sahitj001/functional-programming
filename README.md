# Functional Programming 
For this course I will learn how to create visualisations from external data. Think about cleaning and transforming data, how to use SVG's, use d3 and use d3's scales.

## Design Challenge
**Subject: The car in the city**

How do different municipalities and places deal with parking within the city?

We are going to deliver an interactive data visualization. We must have a good title with a good description. Building is done with a front-end framework.

## Research question

**What are the average parkingcosts per capital city of the province?**

I assume that Amsterdam will be having the highest average parkingcosts since there are the most people. 

## Data I need

- Location of the parking garages
- Rates of parking garage
