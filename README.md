# Functional Programming 
For this course I will learn how to create visualisations from external data. Think about cleaning and transforming data, how to use SVG's, use d3 and use d3's scales.

## Design Challenge
**Subject: The car in the city**

How do different municipalities and places deal with parking within the city?

We are going to deliver an interactive data visualization. We must have a good title with a good description. Building is done with a front-end framework.

## Research question

**How many people make use of all garages within Amsterdam and what is there any specific reason for parking there?**

It could be possible that people park in Amsterdam to work. This also could mean that the garage they park at is free of cost (since their company pays for the parking costs). Another reason also could be that they are parking in Amsterdam because they want to have some fun in Amsterdam.

## Data I need

- Number of garages
- What kind of garage is it?
- Location of the garage (isn't really needed but could be nice)
- Price of the garage (not sure if I need this one)
- Opening hours garage (not sure if I need this one as well)
- Number of people visiting a garage
