# Functional Programming 
For this course I will learn how to create visualisations from external data. Think about cleaning and transforming data, how to use SVG's, use d3 and use d3's scales.

## Design Challenge
**Subject: The car in the city**

How do different municipalities and places deal with parking within the city?

We are going to deliver an interactive data visualization. We must have a good title with a good description. Building is done with a front-end framework.

## Research question

**How much parkingspots do garages have on an average per province?**

I assume that Noord-Holland will have the most parkingspots on average.

## Data I need

[I will be needing the unique identifier of the garages](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-PARKEERGEBIED/mz4f-59fw)

[I will need the parking spots](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s)

[I will need the location of the parking garage](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-Index-Statisch-en-Dynamisch/f6v7-gjpa)
